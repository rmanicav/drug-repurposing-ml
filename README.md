# Drug Repurposing using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to identify
potential drug repurposing opportunities. The objective is to leverage
existing drug–target, drug–gene, and drug–enzyme relationships to discover
new therapeutic applications for approved drugs.

## Approach
- Data integration from multiple biological and chemical sources
- Feature engineering on drug–drug and drug–target relationships
- Supervised machine learning models for candidate prediction
- Comparative analysis of model performance

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble learning techniques

## Results
- Machine learning models identified promising drug candidates for further
  investigation
- Feature-based approaches demonstrated effectiveness in capturing
  biological relationships

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Context
This project was developed as part of applied machine learning research and
demonstrates the use of ML techniques beyond traditional security and energy
domains.
